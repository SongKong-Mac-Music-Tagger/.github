## What is SongKong for Mac?

SongKong for Mac is a **professional music tagging application** that automates the process of organizing and correcting metadata in your audio library. It uses acoustic fingerprinting and online databases to accurately identify tracks, albums, and artists—even when file names are incomplete or incorrect.

The software supports a wide range of audio formats including MP3, FLAC, M4A, WAV, and OGG. Once files are identified, SongKong automatically updates ID3 tags, adds high-resolution album artwork, and sorts your music into a logical folder structure. This saves hours of manual work and ensures your library is consistently organized.

SongKong is fully compatible with **macOS Sonoma, Ventura, Monterey, and Big Sur**, and runs natively on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs. Its clean, intuitive interface makes it accessible for casual users, while its batch processing and advanced matching options meet the needs of professional musicians and archivists.

Whether you’re rebuilding a disorganized iTunes library, preparing files for DJ sets, or archiving a vinyl collection, SongKong delivers reliable, fast, and precise metadata correction.
